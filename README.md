# Tic Tac Toe Game - Flutter & Dart

## Description

This project is a simple yet engaging Tic Tac Toe mobile game built using Flutter and Dart. The game allows two players to compete in the classic 3x3 grid format, taking turns to place their marks. The app features a clean and intuitive user interface, providing a smooth gameplay experience. It showcases my ability to develop cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter, with a focus on responsiveness and performance.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Supports two players, allowing them to compete head-to-head on the same device.
- **Clean UI**: Designed with a minimalistic and user-friendly interface, making the game easy to navigate.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Built with Flutter, ensuring the game runs seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Winning Detection**: Automatically detects winning conditions and highlights the winning combination.
- **Restart Game Option**: Allows players to quickly restart the game after a match ends.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.

## Usage

1. Install the game on an Android or iOS device.
2. Launch the application.
3. Start a new game:
   - Players take turns tapping on the grid to place their marks (X or O).
